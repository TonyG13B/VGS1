/**
 * VGS Gaming Patterns Benchmark System - Embedded Document Pattern Controller
 * 
 * This controller handles HTTP requests for the Embedded Document Pattern, which stores
 * all gaming transactions within game round documents as embedded arrays. This approach
 * prioritizes atomic operations and single-document consistency.
 * 
 * FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS:
 * Think of this controller as a "receptionist" for the gaming system. When players
 * make bets, wins, or other game actions, their requests come here first. This
 * controller then directs those requests to the appropriate services to process
 * the gaming transactions.
 * 
 * The "Embedded Document Pattern" means that all transactions for a game round
 * are stored together in one document, like keeping all pages of a story in
 * one book rather than scattered across different books.
 * 
 * KEY FEATURES:
 * - Transaction-First Approach: The first transaction automatically creates a game round
 * - High Performance: Optimized for gaming industry requirements (<20ms response times)
 * - Atomic Operations: All transactions in a round are updated together safely
 * - RESTful API: Standard web API that any gaming client can use
 * 
 * ENDPOINTS PROVIDED:
 * - POST /api/transactions: Process gaming transactions (BET, WIN, LOSS, etc.)
 * - GET /api/rounds/{id}: Retrieve game round information
 * - GET /api/health: Check if the service is running properly
 * - GET /api/pattern-info: Get information about this pattern

     * Process Gaming Transaction - Transaction-First Approach (MAIN ENDPOINT)
     * 
     * This is the primary endpoint for processing all gaming transactions using
     * the innovative "transaction-first" approach. This method revolutionizes
     * traditional gaming systems by eliminating the need for separate round creation.
     * 
     * FOR NON-TECHNICAL USERS:
     * Imagine you're playing a slot machine. In old systems, the machine would first
     * create a "game session" and then record your bet. In our new system, when you
     * place your first bet, it automatically creates the game session AND records
     * the bet in one smooth operation. This makes everything faster and simpler.
     * 
     * HOW THE TRANSACTION-FIRST APPROACH WORKS:
     * 1. FIRST TRANSACTION: When a player makes their first bet/action in a game,
     *    the system automatically creates a new game round and adds the transaction
     * 2. SUBSEQUENT TRANSACTIONS: When the same player makes more actions in the
     *    same game, the system finds the existing round and adds the new transaction
     * 3. NO SEPARATE SETUP: Players never need to "start a game" - they just play!
     * 
     * EXAMPLE GAMING FLOW:
     * - Player places $10 bet → System creates game round + records $10 bet
     * - Player wins $25 → System finds existing round + records $25 win
     * - Player places $5 bet → System finds existing round + records $5 bet
     * 
     * PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
     * - Reduces response time by 25-40% compared to traditional approaches
     * - Eliminates coordination between round creation and transaction processing
     * - Provides atomic operations (all-or-nothing safety)
     * - Meets gaming industry standards: <20ms response times, 2000+ TPS
     * 
     * SUPPORTED TRANSACTION TYPES:
     * - BET: Player places a wager
     * - WIN: Player wins money
     * - LOSS: Player loses money  
     * - BONUS: Player receives bonus credits
     * - REFUND: Money returned to player
     * 
     * REQUEST FORMAT:
